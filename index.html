              </h1>
              <p>
                The recent floods in Noakhali have caused significant damage to
                homes infrastructure.Noakhali, a coastal district in
                southeastern Bangladesh, has been facing severe floods due to
                heavy rainfall and tidal surges. The rising water levels have
                submerged homes, damaged crops, and disrupted transportation,
                leaving many people stranded. Thousands of families have been
                displaced, seeking refuge in temporary shelters. The flooding
                has also led to a shortage of clean drinking water and essential
                supplies.The flooding in Noakhali has had a devastating impact
                on livelihoods, particularly for farmers and fishermen.
                Farmlands have been inundated, destroying rice paddies and other
                crops, which are vital for the local economy. Many fishermen are
                unable to go to sea, further worsening the financial hardships
                of coastal communities. Schools and healthcare facilities have
                also been affected, with many turning into makeshift shelters
                for displaced families.

              <p>
                The recent Quota movement has resulted in numerous injuries and
                significant hardship for many individuals. Your support is
                crucial in providing medical assistance, rehabilitation, and
                necessary supplies to those affected. By contributing, you help
                ensure that injured individuals receive the care and support
                they need during this challenging time.The Quota Reform Movement
                in Bangladesh, which began in 2018, was marked by widespread
                protests from university students and job seekers demanding
                changes to the governmentâ€™s job quota system. During the height
                of the protests, tensions escalated as clashes between
                protestors and law enforcement became frequent, leading to
                numerous injuries. Many of the injured were students who had
                peacefully gathered but became caught in the violence when
                police used tear gas, water cannons, and batons to disperse the
                crowds.
