Several human rights organizations, political figures, and civil society groups called for immediate medical aid for the injured. Hospitals in Dhaka, particularly Dhaka Medical College Hospital, received the majority of the injured, where doctors and volunteers worked tirelessly to provide care. Many students required urgent surgery, and some were left with long-term injuries, sparking further protests demanding justice for those harmed.
