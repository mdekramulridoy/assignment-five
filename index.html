              <p>
                The recent floods in Noakhali have caused significant damage to
                homes infrastructure.Noakhali, a coastal district in
                southeastern Bangladesh, has been facing severe floods due to
                heavy rainfall and tidal surges. The rising water levels have
                submerged homes, damaged crops, and disrupted transportation,
                leaving many people stranded. Thousands of families have been
                displaced, seeking refuge in temporary shelters. The flooding
                has also led to a shortage of clean drinking water and essential
                supplies.The flooding in Noakhali has had a devastating impact
                on livelihoods, particularly for farmers and fishermen.
                Farmlands have been inundated, destroying rice paddies and other
                crops, which are vital for the local economy. Many fishermen are
                unable to go to sea, further worsening the financial hardships
                of coastal communities. Schools and healthcare facilities have
                also been affected, with many turning into makeshift shelters
                for displaced families.
